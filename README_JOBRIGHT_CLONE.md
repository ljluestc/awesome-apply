### Form Pattern Recognition

The system automatically detects and learns from different application forms:

FORM_PATTERNS = {
    "linkedin": {
        "selectors": [".jobs-apply-button"],
        "success_indicators": ["application submitted"]
    },
    "greenhouse": {
        "selectors": ["input[type='submit']"],
        "success_indicators": ["thank you for your application"]
    }
}
```

### Field Mapping System

Intelligent auto-fill with flexible field detection:

```python
FIELD_MAPPINGS = {
    "first_name": [
        "input[name*='first']",
        "input[id*='first']",
        "input[placeholder*='First']"
    ]
}
```

### Analytics Engine

Comprehensive tracking and reporting:
- Application success rates
- Average completion times
- Form difficulty scoring
- Platform-specific metrics

## 🛡️ Safety & Ethics

### Responsible Usage
- ⚠️ **Review Before Submit**: Always review applications before submission
- 🚦 **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays to respect platform limits
- 📜 **Terms Compliance**: Respect LinkedIn and other platform terms
- 🔒 **Data Privacy**: All data stored locally, no external sharing

### Best Practices
- Configure realistic application limits
- Customize cover letters for each application
- Monitor for detection and adjust usage patterns
- Keep user profile information accurate and up-to-date

## 📊 API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints

        location: 'San Francisco, CA',
        experience_level: 'senior'
    })
});

// Apply to job
const applyResponse = await fetch('/api/apply', {
    method: 'POST',
