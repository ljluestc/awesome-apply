• Built secure multi-cloud automation with TLS and Zero-Trust; implemented eBPF/iptables validation for firewall upgrades and DDoS mitigation; hardened supply chain with SBOM and policy gates.
• Streamlined deployments with 	extbf{	extbf{Docker}} and 	extbf{	extbf{Kubernetes}}; implemented 	extbf{Prometheus}/	extbf{Grafana} for real-time 	extbf{Monitoring}.

My experience spans the full software development lifecycle, from designing scalable architectures to implementing robust CI/CD pipelines. I have consistently delivered measurable results, including reducing deployment times by 30% and improving system reliability.

I am particularly drawn to Nemetschek's commitment to innovation and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my technical expertise and problem-solving abilities can contribute to your team's success.
